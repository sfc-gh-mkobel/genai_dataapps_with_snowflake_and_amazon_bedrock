# Building GenAI Data Apps with Snowflake and AWS Bedrock

## Introduction
Have you ever received marketing spam from a company and wondered why they sent you an email in a language you don't understand?
71% of customers dont want to recieve general mails, but want to be approached on a personal level and 78% of companies asked believe that by approaching customers in a personalized fashion will increase the chance a customer will repurchase if approached in a personalized fashion

In this demo, we will see how to build a GenAI Data app that provides a personalized reccomendation based on past purchases based on the integration between Snowflake Data Clud and AWS Services. We will stream data in near real time (purchases), use company information stoed in documents and GenAI technologies such as Large Language Models and Retrieval Augmented Generation to bring the latest information.
